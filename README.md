Sentiment Analysis using NLP


The aim of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model which will allow us to categorize words based on their sentiments, that is whether they are positive, negative and also the magnitude of it.

Sentiment Analysis is a process of extracting opinions that have different polarities. By polarities, we mean positive, negative or neutral. It is also known as opinion mining and polarity detection. With the help of sentiment analysis, you can find out the nature of opinion that is reflected in documents, websites, social media feed, etc. Sentiment Analysis is a type of classification where the data is classified into different classes. These classes can be binary in nature (positive or negative) or, they can have multiple classes (happy, sad, angry, etc.).
